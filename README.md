## Install

```sh
yarn add @ovh-ux/ng-ovh-responsive-page-switcher
```

## Usage

```js
import angular from 'angular';
import ngOvhResponsivePageSwitcher from '@ovh-ux/ng-ovh-responsive-page-switcher';

angular
  .module('myApp', [
    ngOvhResponsivePageSwitcher,
  ]);
```

It detects available width for displaying page in 2 distinct modes :

* `switch` mode : one page is displayed at a time ;
* `sidebyside` mode : pages are displayed side by side.

__Note__ : `ng-ovh-responsive-page-switcher` is suitable with [ng-ovh-responsive-popover](https://github.com/ovh-ux/ng-ovh-responsive-popover).

#### HTML

Directives `responsive-switch` and `responsive-switch-page` will be used.

`responsive-switch-page` requires `responsive-switch`, so first we create this directive:

```html
<div data-responsive-switch>
    <div class="responsive-switch-page-left"
         data-responsive-switch-page>
    </div>
    <div class="responsive-switch-page-right"
         data-responsive-switch-page>
    </div>
</div>
```
