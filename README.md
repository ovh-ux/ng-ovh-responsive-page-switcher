## Install

```sh
yarn add @ovh-ux/ng-ovh-responsive-page-switcher
```

## Usage

```js
import angular from 'angular';
import ngOvhResponsivePageSwitcher from '@ovh-ux/ng-ovh-responsive-page-switcher';

angular
  .module('myApp', [
    ngOvhResponsivePageSwitcher,
  ]);
```

Directives `responsive-switch` and `responsive-switch-page` will be used. `responsive-switch-page` requires `responsive-switch`, so first we create this directive :

```html
<div data-responsive-switch>
    <div data-responsive-switch-page class="responsive-switch-page-left"></div>
    <div data-responsive-switch-page class="responsive-switch-page-right"></div>
</div>
```

## Test

```sh
yarn test
```
